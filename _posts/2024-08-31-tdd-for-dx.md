As you may already know, I'm a TDD practitioner, and I truly believe that it's one of the practices that helped me significantly in my career, especially when it comes to developer experience and making my life easier.

In this article, I'll explain how TDD helped me and its positive impact on my day-to-day job. I'll refrain from mentioning the technical advantages and limit this article to the developer experience impact.

Let's start from the beginning, the definition.

## Test Driven Development (TDD)

Test-driven development is an approach to driving the implementation of the system’s behavior using executable specifications defined as tests.

That’s a mouthful, let’s break this down with an example. Let’s suppose you talk with your users, and they describe to you a feature they would like to have. You take the feature, you write down it’s different use cases on a piece of paper, or your to-do list, or as a comment in your test file.

You start with the first use case, you write a failing test for it. Then you write the minimum required code to run that use case and then refactor the code to make it better. Then you translate the next use case to a failing test, you write the code to make it pass, then you refactor and you continue until you implement the whole feature.

This simple approach helps with so many aspects.

### Learning the Domain

Breaking down things and trying to think about the next test to write has helped me ask the right questions and dig deeper than what’s written in the user story or the Jira Ticket. It pushes me to get out of my bubble and ask the domain experts, the users, the designer, or any other stakeholder.

Anecdotally, we even had our client in the energy market say that our calculations are more correct than the legacy system because we thought of all cases.

### Tackling Complexity

Some domains are very complex, and breaking down things and learning them bit by bit helps managing the complexity.

Some solutions can be complex, and the ease and confidence to refactor helps with exploring different solutions and potentially finding a simpler one.

### Peace of Mind

Having tests as a safety net, lets me refactor peacefully, and add new features without worrying about breaking things. Pushing code, knowing that I have implemented it as the user expects it, or at least as the team understood the requirements. When something breaks while changing the code, I’m quite certain that it is the last change that caused it and I can just revert to the last green state.

### Feedback Loop

One of the traumas I have with my early days of coding comes from manually iterating while coding a feature, the scenario is as follows :

1. Fill out the fields of a form
2. Submit the form
3. Run a GET request to check if the data is restored properly
4. Clean the database and start over again

and I had to do this for all possible scenarios, if there is one word that can describe this way of working is HELL.

It was a very, very long feedback loop and there is a lot of time-wasting (imagine all the clicks). With TDD, I write the test of the use case and then run it as much as I can until I'm done, if I have a different input I can parameterize the test. If I have a combinatorial explosion, I can isolate the piece of code and run all different use cases on it.

And the perk is that all this is repeatable for the future.

### Interrupt-ability

With the list of your tests, you know where you are and what you have done, and with a failing test you know what you are planning to implement, this will help keep the progress and if your teammates calls you and you get distracted, a simple look at your screen and you will know where to resume. And you can take your lunch break without any overthinking.

These are the main and important points where I think TDD helped, there are certainly other benefits and other practitioner may have experienced some more than others depending on their projects but for me, these are the ones that marked my experience with TDD. 

And what about you? What is the one thing you learned that impacted your career that you have to write about it?
